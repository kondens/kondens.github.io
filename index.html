                            People, even the smartest, are terrible at making good decisions whenever more than a couple of interdependent factors are involved. <br /><br />
                            Our world is full of such complex problems.

                                We are working for a future in which knowledge workers can perform complex analyses in a fraction of the time required today. We want to enable a rich, more efficient transfer of knowledge.

                    We see solving complex problems and making strategic decisions as a continuous cycle of four steps, condensing a vast cloud of factors into concise, well-reasoned and actionable solutions.

                    <div class="row">
                        <p>
                            In solving a problem, we have to formulate and continuously refine our understanding of what
                            we are trying to achieve, as well as all the factors and constraints influencing our solution.

                            <emph>kondens</emph> enables knowledge workers to collaboratively collect relevant facts, note potential associations and correlations, and keep track of it all.

                        <p>
                            Initial observations warranting further investigation have to be backed up by supporting material such as
                            calculations, empirical studies or theoretical models&mdash;thus building up coherent lines of reasoning.

                            <emph>kondens</emph> identifies blank spots, contradicting arguments and unvalidated claims.
                            It also surfaces non-obvious links between hypotheses, which might help in validating them.
                            The resulting conclusions can be shared and explored by co-workers.

                            Separate areas of analysis are put into relation with one another in order to arrive
                            at a holistic understanding of the problem. This enables a substantiated, model-driven discussion
                            of solution candidates under clear assumptions.

                            <emph>kondens</emph> allows users to quickly navigate the information network they are creating, focusing on selected sub-problems or moving between levels of abstraction. New insights and changing assumptions are propagated between collaborators. <emph>kondens</emph> also suggests compromises between competing priorities.

                            The rationale behind conclusions is often lost. This impedes depth and speed of comprehension that is crucial in detecting argumentative flaws, sharing context and reusing acquired knowledge.

                            <emph>kondens</emph> generates clean, consistent memos from argumentative chains. All of the author's considerations and the history of her working steps remain accessible. Uninitiated co-workers and decision makers will therefore learn of the whole thought process by which they were reached.
